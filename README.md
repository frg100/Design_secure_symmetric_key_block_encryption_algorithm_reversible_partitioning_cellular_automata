# Design of a secure symmetric key block encryption algorithm using reversible partitioning cellular automata

This is a research project conducted during the summer of 2016. It is an encryption algorithm that utilizes cellular automata, a simulation of living biological cells

In this repository you can find my code, the data I used, and the final paper pdf
